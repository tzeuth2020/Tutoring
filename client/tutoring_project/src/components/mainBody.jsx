                    <p className="basic-text">
                    Orton-Gillingham is a multi-sensory and explicit instructional approach to teaching students having difficulties with reading (decoding), spelling and writing associated with dyslexia.
                    For maximum success with O-G tutoring, 2-3 times a week is suggested.  Making it through the entire sequence can take 2-4 years depending on the student.  Students who attend sessions consistently through a calendar year progress at a steady pace.  With O-G tutoring, there is not one specific path, but we will work together to assess and tweak the plan as we move through the sequence and monitor your childâ€™s progress.  
                    For additional information on Orton-Gillingham, please visit the <a href="http://www.ortonacademy.org/for-parents/introductory-course-on-the-orton-gillingham-approach/"> Orton-Gillingham site</a>. 
                    There are many Orton-Gillingham programs on the market.  I pull from many of the programs but I use the Wilson Language Program as my foundation.  I really like this program because of the emphasis on reading in context which many others do not include.  If you want to learn more about Wilson, please visit <a href="http://www.wilsonlanguage.com">their page</a>. </p>
